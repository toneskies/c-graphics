Rendering pipeline:

Model Space
|    Everything starts in model space. Raw local coordinates for the models (ie. Blender, Maya, etc..)
v
World Space
|    Positioning the 3d model in the correct place in the world (affine transformations - rotation, translation, scaling).
v
Camera Space
|    Translate and rotate so the center coordinate system is the eye (camera), +Z grows inside monitor (depending on handedness)
|
(Backface Culling)
|    Cull elements using z-buffer
v
Frustum Clipping
|    Clip Top/Bot/Left/Right/Near/Far
v
Projection
|    Projecting the elements from 
| -----------------------------------------> CLIPPING SPACE USUALLY HAPPENS HERE (most renderers will perform clipping after projection and before perspective divide)
(Perspective Divide)
|    x/w, y/w, z/w, w
v
Image Space (NDC)
|    Normalized Device Coordinates (cube -1 to 1 for each face)
v
Screen Space
|    Where the user sees 3d perspective graphics
v
